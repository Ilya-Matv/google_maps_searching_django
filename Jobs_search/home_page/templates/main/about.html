    <h1> About me</h1>
    <h5>Hello! I am a newcomer to Canada who, while here, overcame the difficulties of moving and at the same time figured out how to create websites using the Django framework. My website searches for companies in Google Maps and displays links to these websites for the user. I hope you manage to find a job!</h5>
